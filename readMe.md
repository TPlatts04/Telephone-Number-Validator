# Telephone number Validator 

This project here is able to validate any given American number within it's input element.
The project here is project (3/5) which goes towards achieving my certification within freecodecamp's
**JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta)** course. So far this course has helped me learn a large amount of JavaScript along
with my other certification which is of similar calibre however, for the projects you conver them to HTML, CSS and integrate JS into this newer certification.

# Usage

This Telephone Number Validator is able to cheeck whether any number is eligible to be an American's contact number. Any phone company is able to use this to run through a large 
amount of phone numbers to ensure that they are assigning valid numbers instead of them being void and affecting the customers QOL with the phone.
